# Fluster Installer
This project is made by Revamp.

This installer installs a patched version of roblox UWP, that means that you will be playing on a version without hyperion (allowing you to exploit) 

Everything is possible because of cerealwithmilk that created this patched version, you can find his github [here](https://github.com/cerealwithmilk/uwp)

### How is this possible?
Fluster works by spoofing the version headers, to trick roblox into thinking that you are playing latest UWP version.

### What executors to use?
We are currently creating our own executer, at the moment, we recommend Electron, you can download it [here](https://ryos.lol)
You could also use fluxus, but you need modded version of it.

### Discord Support
